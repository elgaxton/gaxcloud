I started by connecting to EC2 in amazon account and creating an instance
Afterwards, I downloaded the putty program from putty.org and also downloaded puttygen 
I created my  keypairs in amazon and dowloaded the .em and converted it to .ppk using the puttygen program
I inputed details of my instace created at EC2 such as public IP and then followed the tutorials concerning logging into virtual Linux using EC2 and the login was successful.

After the above, I went on install Apache using the "$sudo apt update " and "$ sudo apt install apache2"
I then followed the steps as outlined in the website: https://starter-pbl.darey.io/en/latest/project1.html and at the end, I was able to achieve the Hello Lamp page index.html file

I was also able to connect Php to apache and get the index.php file working!
Attached herewith are some of the screenshots of the project I did
